# Thales integrated map and sensor system

## Aims 
Autonomous systems live in the real world and need to understand the real world in all dimensions. Thales' wish to start a demonstration system that will support both manned and unmanned systems on the 3D map. This project will provide a first concept demonstration to help understand feasibility of the concept.

## Directories
[ElectronJS Application](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/tp3-2020-CS01/cs01-main/-/tree/master/ElectronJSApp)

- This directory hosts the 2D concept of the project aims based on a based on Node.js and Chromium framework and uses the CesiumJS API. However, during the development of this application, the developers discovered a lot of drawbacks within the API which hindered progress and had the team looking for different solutions.

[ThalesArc](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/tp3-2020-CS01/cs01-main/-/tree/master/ThalesArc)

- This directory hosts the 3D concept and works in accordance to the [ThalesArcSimulationScript](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/tp3-2020-CS01/cs01-main/-/tree/master/ThalesArcSimulationScript). It is based on the JavaFX API which enables us to cross-platform desktop applications with the added support of ArcGIS Java SDK which powers the map provided in the application. 
  

## [Dissertation](https://stgit.dcs.gla.ac.uk/tp3-2020-CS01/cs01-dissertation/-/blob/master/template/dissertation.pdf)
- Team CS01's dissertation can be found at this repository. The dissertation presents a case study of the development of a sensors mapping system. The  application takes data from a handheld sensor  system like the SOPHIE LITE Electrical External ICD device, and represents point of interests on the application map.
